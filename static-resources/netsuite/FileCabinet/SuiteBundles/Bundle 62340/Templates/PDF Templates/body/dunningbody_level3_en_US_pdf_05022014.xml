    <p>This is an important letter and requires your immediate attention. Despite sending you several reminders, we have received no response from you about your seriously past due account. We feel we have given you ample time and have been more than patient with you. It is our normal policy to pass-on seriously delinquently accounts to a third party collection agency or our legal counsel. This could further jeopardize you credit rating in the industry. You can avoid this by sending us a check today for the full amount due. If we do not receive your payment within the next five days, we are going to have to take action.</p>
    <p>You have a total outstanding balance of ${customer.overduebalance} with the following invoices overdue:</p>
